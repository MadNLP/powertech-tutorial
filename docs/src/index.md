# Tutorials

This page hosts the materials for the tutorial
"GPU-accelerated optimization for power systems with MadNLP and ExaModels"
presented at [PowerTech 2025](https://2025.ieee-powertech.org/tutorials/#1744358367373-8b3025fb-3285)
by [Alexis Montoison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-montoison/),
[Fran√ßois Pacaud](https://frapac.github.io/)
and [Sungho Shin](https://shin.mit.edu/).

## Description
The tutorials present how to solve the AC power flow using GPU-accelerated nonlinear programming.
They proceed by order of difficulty, starting by the solution of the power flow equations and
end with the solution of large-scale optimal power flow instances.

## Data
You can download all the instances we used in the tutorials
on this [webpage](https://cloud.minesparis.psl.eu/index.php/s/8nfxDqzz41H0rpE).
